# Bolt Protocol Message Specification - Version 4


* [**Version 4.0**](#version-40)

* [**Version 4.1**](#version-41)

* [**Version 4.2**](#version-42)

* [**Appendix - Bolt Message Exchange Examples**](#appendix---bolt-message-exchange-examples)


**Note:** *Byte values are represented using hexadecimal notation unless otherwise specified.*


# Version 4.0

## Deltas

The changes compared to Bolt protocol version 3 are listed below:

* `DISCARD_ALL` message renamed to `DISCARD` and introduced new fields.
* `PULL_ALL` message renamed to `PULL` and introduced new fields.
* The `BEGIN` message now have a field `db::String` to specify a database name.
* The `RUN` message now have a field `db::String` to specify a database name.
* **Explicit Transaction** (`BEGIN`+`RUN`) can now get a server response with a `SUCCESS` and metadata key `qid` (query identification).
* The `DISCARD` message can now discard an arbitrary number of records. New fields `n` and `qid`.
* The `DISCARD` message can now get a server response with a `SUCCESS` and metadata key `has_more`. 
* The `PULL` message can now fetch an arbitrary number of records. New fields `n` and `qid`.
* The `PULL` message can now get a server response with a `SUCCESS` and metadata key `has_more`. 



## Overview of Major Version Changes

The handshake have been re-specified to support Major and Minor versions.

The concept of multi database support have been introduced with the field `db::String` for the request message `BEGIN` and the request message `RUN`.

Queries within an **Explicit Transaction** can be consumed out of order with the new behaviour of `PULL` and `DISCARD`.

```
PULL {"n": ?, "qid": ?}
```

```
DISCARD {"n": ?, "qid": ?}
```

The `qid` is included in the `SUCCESS` response of a `RUN` message within an **Explicit Transaction** (`BEGIN`+`RUN`).
See [Appendix - Example 4](#example-4).


## Bolt Protocol Server State Specification

For the server, each connection using the Bolt Protocol will occupy one of several states throughout its lifetime.

This state is used to determine what actions may be undertaken by the client.

See, [**Bolt Protocol Server State Specification Version 4**]({% link bolt/bolt-protocol-server-state-specification-4.md %})


### Server Signals

Jump ahead is that the signal will imediatly be available before any messages are processed in the message queue.

| Server Signal   | Jump Ahead | Description            |
|:----------------|:----------:|------------------------|
| `<INTERRUPT>`   | x          | an interrupt signal    |
| `<DISCONNECT>`  |            | a disconnect signal    |


### Protocol Errors

If a server or client receives a message type that is unexpected, according to the transitions described in this document, it must treat that as a protocol error.
Protocol errors are fatal and should immediately transition the server state to `DEFUNCT`, closing any open connections.


## Message Exchange

Messages are exchanged in a request-response pattern between client and server.

Each request consists of exactly one message and each response consists of zero or more detail messages followed by exactly one summary message.
The presence or absence of detail messages in a response is directly related to the type of request message that has been sent.
In other words, some request message types elicit a response that may contain detail messages, others do not.

Messages may also be pipelined. In other words, clients may send multiple requests eagerly without first waiting for responses.

When a failure occurs in this scenario, the server **must** ignore all subsequent requests until the connection from the server side is in the `READY` state.
This prevents inadvertent execution of queries that may not be valid.


### Serialization

Messages and their contents are serialized into network streams using [**PackStream Specification Version 1**]({% link packstream/packstream-specification-1.md %}).

**Each message is represented as a PackStream structure**, that contains a fixed number of fields.

The message type is denoted by the PackStream structure **tag byte** and each message is defined in the Bolt protocol.

**Serialization is specified with PackStream Version 1.**


### Chunking

A layer of chunking is also applied to message transmissions as a way to more predictably manage packets of data.

The chunking process allows the message to be broken into one or more pieces, each of an arbitrary size, and for those pieces to be transmitted within separate chunks.

Each chunk consists of a **two-byte header**, detailing the chunk size in bytes followed by the chunk data itself.
Chunk headers are **16-bit unsigned integers**, meaning that the maximum theoretical chunk size permitted is 65,535 bytes.

Each encoded message **must** be terminated with a chunk of zero size, i.e.

```
00 00
```

This is used to signal message boundaries to a receiving parties, allowing blocks of data to be fully received without requiring that the message is parsed immediately.
This also allows for unknown message types to be received and handled without breaking the messaging chain.

The Bolt protocol encodes each message using a chunked transfer encoding.

* Each message is transferred as one or more chunks of data.
* Each chunk starts with a two-byte header, an unsigned big-endian 16-bit integer, representing the size of the chunk not including the header.
* A message can be divided across multiple chunks, allowing client and server alike to transfer large messages without having to determine the length of the entire message in advance.
* Chunking applies on each message individually.
* One chunk cannot contain more than one message.
* Each message ends with two bytes with the value `00 00`, these are not counted towards the chunk size. (Or you can think they are individual chunks of size 0)


This section provides some examples to illustrate how Bolt chunks messages.

Example: **A message in one chunk**

Message data containing 16 bytes,

```
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
```

The chunk,

```
00 10 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 00 00
```

chunk header: `00 10`

end marker: `00 00`


Example: **A message split in two chunks**

Message data containig 20 bytes:

```
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 01 02 03 04
```

chunk 1,
chunk 2,

```
00 10 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
00 04 01 02 03 04 00 00
```

chunk 1 header: `00 10`

chunk 1 end marker: no end marker, still message data

chunk 2 header: `00 04`

chunk 2 end marker: `00 00`


Example: **Two messages**


Message 1 data containing 16 bytes:

```
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
```

Message 2 data containing 8 bytes:

```
0F 0E 0D 0C 0B 0A 09 08
```

The two messages encoded with chunking,

```
00 10 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 00 00
00 08 0F 0E 0D 0C 0B 0A 09 08 00 00
```


### Pipelining

The client may send multiple requests eagerly without first waiting for responses.


### Transaction

A [transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction) is the concept of [atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)) units of work.

An **Auto-commit Transaction** is a basic but limited form of transaction.

The concept of **Auto-commit Transaction** is when the server is in the `READY` state and the transaction is opened with the request message `RUN` and the response of a summary message `SUCCESS`.

The **Auto-commit Transaction** is successfully closed with the summary message `SUCCESS` and not containing the field `has_more::true` for the request message `PULL` or `DISCARD`.
Thus the **Auto-commit Transaction** can only contain one `RUN` request message.

Example 1:

```
...
C: HELLO ...
S: SUCCESS ...  // Server is in READY state

C: RUN ...      // Open a new Auto-commit Transaction
S: SUCCESS ...  // Server is in STREAMING state

C: PULL ...
S: RECORD ...
   ...
S: RECORD ...
S: SUCCESS ... has_more=true  // Server is still in STREAMING state

C: PULL
S: RECORD ...
   ...
S: RECORD ...
S: SUCCESS ... has_more=false  // Server is in READY state and this implies that the Auto-commit Transaction is closed.
```

See, [**Bolt Protocol Server State Specification Version 4**]({% link bolt/bolt-protocol-server-state-specification-4.md %}#appendix---bolt-message-state-transitions)

An **Explicit Transaction** is a more generic transaction that can contain several `RUN` request messages.

The concept of **Explicit Transaction** is when the server is in the `READY` state and the transaction is opened with the request message `BEGIN` and the response of a summary message `SUCCESS` (thus transition into the `TX_READY` server state).

The **Explicit Transaction** is successfully closed with the request message `COMMIT` and the response of a summary message `SUCCESS`.
The result stream (detail messages) must be fully consumed or discarded by a client before the server can transition to the `TX_READY` state and thus be able to close the transaction with a `COMMIT` request message.

The **Explicit Transaction** can be gracefully discarded and set to the initial server state of `READY` with the request message `ROLLBACK`.


Example 2:

```
...
C: HELLO ...
S: SUCCESS ...  // Server is in READY state

C: BEGIN ...    // Open a new Explicit Transaction
S: SUCCESS ...  // Server is in TX_READY state

C: RUN ...
S: SUCCESS ... qid=123 // Server is in TX_STREAMING state, one stream is open

C: RUN ...
S: SUCCESS ... qid=456 // Server is in TX_STREAMING state, two streams are open

C: PULL ... qid=123
S: RECORD ...
   ...
S: RECORD ...
S: SUCCESS ... has_more=true  // Server is still in TX_STREAMING state, two streams are still open

C: PULL ... qid=123
S: RECORD ...
   ...
S: RECORD ...
S: SUCCESS ... has_more=false  // Server is still in TX_STREAMING state, one stream is still open

C: PULL ... qid=456
S: RECORD ...
   ...
S: RECORD ...
S: SUCCESS ... has_more=false  // Server is in TX_READY state, all streams have been fully consumed

C: COMMIT   // Close the Explicit Transaction
S: SUCCESS  // Server is in READY state
```

### Request Message - `HELLO`

The `HELLO` message request the connection to be authorized for use with the remote database.

The server **must** be in the `CONNECTED` state to be able to process a `HELLO` message.
For any other states, receipt of an `HELLO` request **must** be considered a protocol violation and lead to connection closure.

Clients should send `HELLO` message to the server immediately after connection and process the corresponding response before using that connection in any other way.

If authentication fails, the server **must** respond with a `FAILURE` message and immediately close the connection.

Clients wishing to retry initialization should establish a new connection.

**Signature:** `01`

**Fields:**

```
extra::Dictionary(
  user_agent::String,
  scheme::String,
  principal::String,
  credentials::String,
)
```

  - The `user_agent` should conform to `"Name/Version"` for example `"Example/4.0.0"`. (see, [developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent))
  - The `scheme` is the authentication scheme. Predefined schemes are `"none"`, `"basic"`, `"kerberos"`.

**Detail Messages:**

No detail messages should be returned.

**Valid Summary Messages:**

* `SUCCESS`
* `FAILURE`


#### Synopsis

```
HELLO {user_agent::String, scheme::String, principal::String, credentials::String}
```

Example:

```
HELLO {"user_agent": "Example/4.0.0", "scheme": "basic", "principal": "user-id-1", "credentials": "user-password"}
```


#### Server Response `SUCCESS`

A `SUCCESS` message response indicates that the client is permitted to exchange further messages.
Servers can include metadata that describes details of the server environment and/or the connection.

The following fields are defined for inclusion in the `SUCCESS` metadata.

  - `server::String`, the server agent string. e.g. `"Neo4j/4.0.0"`.
  - `connection_id::String`, an unique identifier of the bolt connection used on the server side. e.g. `"bolt-61"`.

Example:

```
SUCCESS {"server": "Neo4j/4.0.0", "connection_id": "bolt-61"}
```


#### Server Response `FAILURE`

A `FAILURE` message response indicates that the client is not permitted to exchange further messages.
Servers may choose to include metadata describing the nature of the failure but **must** immediately close the connection after the failure has been sent.

Example:

```
FAILURE {"code": "Example.Failure.Code", "message": "example failure"}
```


### Request Message - `GOODBYE`

The `GOODBYE` message notifies the server that the connection is terminating gracefully.

On receipt of this message, the server should immediately shut down the socket on its side without sending a response.

A client may shut down the socket at any time after sending the `GOODBYE` message.

This message interrupts the server current work if there is any.

**Signature:** `02`

**Fields:**

No fields.

**Detail Messages:**

No detail messages should be returned.

**Valid Summary Messages:**

No summary message should be returned.

#### Synopsis

```
GOODBYE
```

Example:

```
GOODBYE
```

### Request Message - `RESET`

The `RESET` message requests that the connection should be set back to its initial state, as if a `HELLO` message had just been successfully completed.

The `RESET` message is unique in that it on arrival at the server, it jumps ahead in the message queue, stopping any unit of work that happens to be executing.

All the queued messages originally in front of the `RESET` message will then be `IGNORED` until the `RESET` position is reached.
Then from this point, the server state is reset to a state that is ready for a new session.

**Signature:** `0F`

**Fields:**

No fields.

**Detail Messages:**

No detail messages should be returned.

**Valid Summary Messages:**

No summary message should be returned.

#### Synopsis

```
RESET
```

Example:

```
RESET
```

### Request Message - `RUN`

The `RUN` message requests that a Cypher query is executed with a set of parameters and additional extra data.

This message could both be used in an **Explicit Transaction** or an **Auto-commit Transaction**.
The transaction type is implied by the order of message sequence.

**Signature:** `10`

**Fields:**

```
query::String,
paramaters::Dictionary,
extra::Dictionary(
  bookmarks::List<String>,
  tx_timeout::Integer,
  tx_metadata::Dictionary,
  mode::String,
  db:String,
)
```

  - The `query` can be a Cypher syntax or a procedure call.
  - The `parameters` is a dictionary of parameters to be used in the `query` string.

  An **Explicit Transaction** (`BEGIN`+`RUN`) does not carry any data in the `extra` field.

  For **Auto-commit Transaction** (`RUN`) the `extra` field carries:

  - The `bookmarks` is a list of strings containg some kind of bookmark identification e.g ["neo4j-bookmark-transaction:1", "neo4j-bookmark-transaction:2"]
  - The `tx_timeout` is an integer in that specifies a transaction timeout in ms.
  - The `tx_metadata` is a dictionary that can contain some metadata information, mainly used for logging.
  - The `mode` specifies what kind of server the `RUN` message is targeting. For write access use `"w"` and for read access use `"r"`. Defaults to write access if no mode is sent.
  - The `db` specifies the database name for multi-database to select where the transaction takes place. If no `db` is sent or empty string it implies that it is the default database.

**Detail Messages:**

No detail messages should be returned.

**Valid Summary Messages:**

* `SUCCESS`
* `IGNORED`
* `FAILURE`

#### Synopsis

```

# Version 4.1

## Deltas

The changes compared to Bolt protocol version 4.0 are listed below:

* The `BEGIN` message, defines the sub-field `routing::Dictionary(address::String)` to indicate if server side routing should be performed and can include routing context data.
* Support for `NOOP` chunk (empty chunk). Both server and client should support this.


## Overview

Bolt handshake should now timeout (off by default) on the server side.

The initial address that the client knows the server by is sent with the `HELLO` message to help with routing information.
See [Appendix - Example 3](#example-3).

The `NOOP` chunk (empty chunk) is used to send an empty chunk and the purpose is to be able to support a keep alive behaviour on the connection.

Example: **Two messages with a NOOP in between**


Message 1 data containing 16 bytes:

```
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
```

Message 2 data containing 8 bytes:

```
0F 0E 0D 0C 0B 0A 09 08
```

The two messages encoded with chunking and a `NOOP` (empty chunk) in between.

```
00 10 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 00 00
00 00
00 08 0F 0E 0D 0C 0B 0A 09 08 00 00
```

### Request Message - 4.1 - `HELLO`

The `HELLO` message request the connection to be authorized for use with the remote database.

The server **must** be in the `CONNECTED` state to be able to process a `HELLO` message.
For any other states, receipt of an `HELLO` request **must** be considered a protocol violation and lead to connection closure.

Clients should send `HELLO` message to the server immediately after connection and process the corresponding response before using that connection in any other way.

If authentication fails, the server **must** respond with a `FAILURE` message and immediately close the connection.

Clients wishing to retry initialization should establish a new connection.

The new `routing::Dictionary(address::String)` field adds an indicator if the server should carry out routing, according to the the given routing context.

**Signature:** `01`

**Fields:**

```
extra::Dictionary(
  user_agent::String,
  scheme::String,
  principal::String,
  credentials::String,
  routing::Dictionary(address::String),
)
```

  - The `user_agent` should conform to `"Name/Version"` for example `"Example/4.1.0"`. (see, [developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent))
  - The `scheme` is the authentication scheme. Predefined schemes are `"none"`, `"basic"`, `"kerberos"`.
  - The `routing` field should contain routing context information and the `address` field that should contain the address that the client initially tries to connect with e.g. `"x.example.com:9001"`. Key-value entries in the routing context should correspond exactly to those in the original URI query string. The absence of the `routing` field indicates that the server should not carry out any routing.








**Detail Messages:**

No detail messages should be returned.

**Valid Summary Messages:**

* `SUCCESS`
* `FAILURE`

#### Server Response `SUCCESS`

A `SUCCESS` message response indicates that the client is permitted to exchange further messages.
Servers can include metadata that describes details of the server environment and/or the connection.

The following fields are defined for inclusion in the `SUCCESS` metadata.

  - `server::String` (server agent string, example `"Neo4j/4.1.0"`)
  - `connection_id::String` (unique identifier of the bolt connection used on the server side, example: `"bolt-61"`)

Example:

```
SUCCESS {"server": "Neo4j/4.0.0"}
```


#### Server Response `FAILURE`

A `FAILURE` message response indicates that the client is not permitted to exchange further messages.
Servers may choose to include metadata describing the nature of the failure but **must** immediately close the connection after the failure has been sent.

Example:

```
FAILURE {"code": "Example.Failure.Code", "message": "example failure"}
```
